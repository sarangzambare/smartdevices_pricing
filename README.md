This repository is for data collection and analysis of smart-devices(smartphones, tablets, watches).

The data are scraped from https://www.gsmarena.com. As of the current time, it involves 15 features namely:

1. Product Name
2. LTE or not
3. Year announced
4. Weight
5. Display type
6. Display size
7. PPI (Pixels Per Inch)
8. CPU (in GHz)
9. Internal memory
10. RAM
11. Rear Camera (in MP)
12. Front Camera (in MP)
13. Bluetooth Version
14. Battery (in mAh)
15. Price

Currently, I am aiming at about 2000 devices (inclusive of smartphones, tablets and watches), from about 40 manufacturers.

### This is a living repository and I plan to :

- Generate a well documented dataset summarising the above mentioned features for over 2000 devices.
- Employ various supervised regression techniques like linear, natural splines, including tree-based methods like random-forests.
- Use this as an educational dataset to experiment with validation techniques like cross-validation and bootstrap.
- Explore patterns in the data by employing unsupervised techniques like PCA and Clustering.
